Ok, that might be a little melodramtic. I can still read, I just can't read large volumes of text. By this I mean books, long blog post or anything that involves reading continuously for more than a few minutes. I dont know when this happened but I realised it a couple of days ago when I tried read ... Thinking slow and fast. 

There used to ba time when I did nothing but read. Both fictional and non. I once read the beach (by alex garland) in one sitting. I started at 7am and finshed at 2am the following day. That is a particular engrossing book, but that didn't matter. The key programming book whilst at university was called dietel and deitel.

This isn't a particularly good book. Packed full of information but its very dry and the formatting was, well, take a look

But I could still read books like this for long periods of time. 

# so what changed?

I'm been thinking about this and my habits have changed. It used to be that you had to read a book to learn about a progamming subject and find answers. Now you can get an answer on SO or other sites almost instantly. Most of the time to glancing (find the proper term for this of quick readig) and copy and pasting example code straight into your solution (I don't adivise this, but you know what I mean). 

You can also learn via video now with sites such as pluralsight. 

# Does it matter
