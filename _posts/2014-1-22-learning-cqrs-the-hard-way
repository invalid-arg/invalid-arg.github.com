I've decided to level up. Or so thats what the CQRS guys over at jabbr would have me believe. Infact its not just CQRS I'm attempting to learn. I'm diving into event sourcing and domain driven design as well as the three seem to go hand in hand. There is just one problem with all this. It seems very difficult and the material on it seems overly complex. So I'm hoping with a series of blog posts explaining what I've learnt that somebody will point out where I'm wrong and maybe somebody will. 

So lets address the first point. what is CQRS

people think its ES when its not its just about seperating
