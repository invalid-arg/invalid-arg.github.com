                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>For those of you who don’t know, I did my first talk a couple of nights ago (29/8/2013) at <a href="http://www.leeds-sharp.org/">Leeds Sharp</a>. It was on <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">Nancy</a> and I think it went pretty well. However, I’ve already noticed a lot of ways that I need to improve.</p>

<p>I organised my talk like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>A quick introduction about me and what I do.</li>

<li>An introduction to the Nancy framework. When it was created, why and by whom.</li>

<li>I talked about the <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Introduction#the-super-duper-happy-path">Super Duper Happy Path</a>.</li>

<li>I demonstrated how to create a NancyModule and explained some of the benefits.</li>

<li>I gave examples on how to use route arguments, model bind and validate.</li>

<li>I showed how to create and return views.</li>

<li>I covered testing and the Nancy testing framework.</li>

<li>Finally I implemented Nancy into an existing ASP.NET MVC application.</li>
</ol>

<p>It took a little over an hour and I realised I need to do these things:</p>

<h2 id="relax">Relax</h2>

<p>I’m not a nervous person by nature, but this was a new experience for me. I’ve given talks before but never to my peers, so I was a little nervous. I found taking 5 minutes to calm myself down before entering the room really helped.</p>

<h2 id="speak_slowly">Speak Slowly</h2>

<p>Because you are going to be nervous you’re naturally going to want to talk more, or at least that’s what happened to me. I made a conscious effort to slow my speech down. Not the point that I sounded like I was being played at half speed, but just enough so that it gave me time to think about my sentences.</p>

<h2 id="learn_the_lingo">Learn the Lingo</h2>

<p>I know one of the things I do a lot of at work or during normal conversation is to replace terms with “thingy” or “whats-it”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know that whats-it that pulls out the data. Can you use the thingy pattern on it. Yeah you know what I mean??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no they don’t. I spent time learning the proper terminology for the field and made sure that I used it.</p>

<h2 id="avoid_catchphrases">Avoid Catchphrases</h2>

<p>I didn’t do very well on this during my talk. I must have said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it works like that “straight out of the box”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So many times. I knew I was constantly repeating it but I couldn’t think of anything else to say. I think speaking slower helped me to avoid doing this more, but its something I’m going to have to work on.</p>

<h2 id="if_you_dont_know_the_answer_just_admit_it">If you don’t know the answer just admit it</h2>

<p>I think this is the biggest fear for anybody giving a talk. It was for me. But then I realised, unless you’re Jon Skeet, there are going to be gaps in your knowledge. This is the case for everybody. I decided if I didn’t know the answer I would just say. But I would also offer to find out for them, or give them a way to find out themselves.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>Have notes. You’re going to forget what you are wanting to show. I did and I couldn’t get access to my notes due to lack of internet connection. It wasn’t a disaster, but it could have been.</p>

<h2 id="have_a_finished_demo">Have a Finished Demo</h2>

<p>I knew there was the possibility that something could go wrong. Probably because I’d lose the ability to type with all those people watching me. I figured if I had a demo to go back to, it wouldn’t be as big an issue.</p>

<h2 id="dont_use_resharper_or_shortcuts">Don’t use Resharper or Shortcuts</h2>

<p>I wanted people to follow along with my talk as the crowd was only small. I realised soon into it that if I start flicking around with Resharper shortcuts nobody would be able to follow. Better still I tried to use the mouse for navigation. I think this made it easier to follow.</p>

<h2 id="keep_your_examples_simple">Keep your examples simple</h2>

<p>I went to NDC at Oslo this year and watched a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfowl">@davidfowl</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards">@DamianEdwards</a>. During the course of their talk they coded, from scratch, a basic SignalR example. I was very impressed, you really should watch <a href="http://vimeo.com/68383353">it</a>. There was no way I could do anything so complicated under pressure. So I decided to keep my examples simple then less could go wrong.</p>

<h2 id="you_can_never_have_enough_water">You can never have enough water</h2>

<p>My throat has never been so dry. I had one small cup of water. Big mistake. I need to make sure I have at least a bottle but not drink so much I need the toilet :D</p>

<p>So thats pretty much it. These are the things I realised after my first talk. I’m hoping to do more soon and to get out into the wider community as I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I’ve got a feeling I’m going to learn a lot more than the people in my audience do!</p>
